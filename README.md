## Project: Genealogy

This project covers the concept of Genealogy (tracing the line of descendants from an ancestor or vise versa). It gets the media related to a person or all the people who are related to that person. This relation is defined by the degree of cousinship, which is determined from the common ancestor they have and the number of generations that separate the person from common ancestor. Based on all this information the project gives answer for how two people are related, metadata (references, notes) about person X, finding the descendants and ancestors of person X till a given number of generations, find pictures using the tags or place associated with it within a time range, find the pictures that include immediate family members of person X.
